# NGordnet
Browser-based tool to explore the history of word usage in English texts and hyper/hyponym word relations.

# To Run:

Clone the repository, and at the /proj level add a directory called /data with the data from this link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xGTZqCo5maiZjA307OPocmKDOTYlJXnz/view?usp=sharing)
placed inside of the directory.

Navigate to Main.java and run the file, then navigate to the /static directory, where you should find a ngordnet.html file. Open this file to interact with the application after it has been started.
